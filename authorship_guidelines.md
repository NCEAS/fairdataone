# Authorship Policy for "Improving data curation through FAIR assessment in the DataONE repository network" manuscript

The group has drafted a list of responsibilities for manuscript co-authors. The goal is to have an open dialog regarding authorship and to clearly define each co-author’s responsibilities and accomplishments throughout the effort.  Below are common contributions made by co-authors. We feel that co-authorship requires roughly 2-3 contributions below, the appropriate minimum depending on individual circumstances. We also feel that these contributions need to occur within the timeline established for the paper. Note that some contributions often relegated to the acknowledgments section are included, but that those who contribute in only one category would be placed in the acknowledgments.

We highlight one view on this distinction below from Weltzin et al. 2006: *Drawing the line between acknowledgements and co-authorship can be challenging and one way of thinking about the differences may be to consider whether or not the participant is responsible and accountable for the article. A contributor receiving credit for the article should be willing to be held accountable for its contents and not be just responsible for a portion of work involved. In contrast, an acknowledgement may contribute formal or informal ideas to ongoing projects, collect enormous amounts of data, and develop and/or conduct statistical analyses, but may not be accountable for the final contents of all or even portions of the final manuscript.*

We ask that you consider the following table with the description of contributions for each activity. Prior to manuscript submission, each contributor will be asked to fill out the table
listing their specific contributions in each area.

| Activity | Specific Contributions|
|----------|-----------------------|
| **Concieved of the idea for the MS** - e.g. framing the question or objectives| |
| **Designed the MS** – help determine structure of the MS, the intellectual content and scope, etc.| |
|**Supervised** – oversight and responsibility for the organization of the project and manuscript| |
|**Performed research - Data collection **| |
|**Performed research - Data analysis** | |
| **Contributed new methods**| |
|**Drafted figures and tables**| |
|**Performed critical reviews** – reworking the manuscript for intellectual context before submission, not just spelling and grammar checking, within three weeks of receiving the draft. | |
|**Other** – other contributions not listed above, please specify.||
