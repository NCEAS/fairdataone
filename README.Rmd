## Contents

- [:file\_folder: manuscript](/manuscript): R Markdown source document
  for manuscript. Includes code to reproduce the figures and tables
  generated by the analysis. It also has a rendered version,
  `manuscript.pdf`, suitable for reading (the code is replaced by figures
  and tables in this file)
- [:file\_folder: data](/manuscript/data): Data used in the analysis. Most
  data are retrieved from a data archive, but small static data files may also
  be retrieved from this directory.
- [:file\_folder: figures](/manuscript/figures): Plots and other illustrations.

## How to run run locally

This research compendium has been developed using the statistical programming
language R. To work with the compendium, you will need
installed on your computer the [R software](https://cloud.r-project.org/)
itself and optionally [RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

After downloading the compendium from GitHub:

- open the `.Rproj` file in RStudio
- run `devtools::install()` to ensure you have the packages this analysis 
  depends on (also listed in the [DESCRIPTION](/DESCRIPTION) file). This also 
  installs the `fairdataone` package, which is necessary to Knit the manuscript.
- finally, open `manuscript/manuscript.Rmd` and knit to produce the `manuscript.pdf`, 
  or run `rmarkdown::render("manuscript/manuscript.Rmd")` in the R console.
